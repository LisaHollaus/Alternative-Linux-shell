# os_project

TODO:
- Documentation
- quit process (therefore we need functions that keep track of current processes)
- make sure the file function doesn't overwrite old outputs when file already exists
- Makefile
- structere (functions in functions.c, functions.h for declairations, only main process in imcsh.c)
